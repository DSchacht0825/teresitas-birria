                <h2>A Story of Family, Love, and Tradition - How We Became Waco's #1 Food Truck</h2>
                <p><strong>From humble beginnings to Waco's most beloved food truck:</strong> The heartwarming journey of how our beloved babysitter Tere's incredible birria recipes became the foundation for what locals now call "the best Mexican food in Waco." Today, we proudly serve as Central Texas's premier authentic Mexican catering service.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="story-content">
                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>In 2018, we were blessed to find the most loving, nurturing babysitter for our daughter. Her name was Tere — or Teresita, as we affectionately called her — and she ran a small daycare from her home. She had a gentle heart, endless patience, and a gift for caring for children that made every family feel like they'd found someone truly special.</p>
                    
                    <p>Then the pandemic hit in 2020, and everything changed. Parents began keeping their children at home, and Tere's daycare — like so many small businesses — came to an abrupt halt. She was suddenly left without income, and we were heartbroken to see someone so selfless and devoted face such uncertainty.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>But here's where the story takes a beautiful turn.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>Long before the shutdowns, we had already discovered another one of Tere's gifts — her birria. Rich, deeply flavorful, slow-cooked for hours — it was hands down the best we'd ever tasted. So we came to her with an idea:</p>
                    
                    <p><em>What if we brought your birria to the world… on wheels?</em></p>
                    
                    <p>She said yes. And just like that, Teresita's Birria was born — a humble food truck with a big heart, built on family, tradition, and community. We started small, serving at local events and pop-ups, sharing her birria with friends, neighbors, and eventually, long lines of hungry, happy customers.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Word spread fast — and spread everywhere.</strong> What began as a way to support someone we loved became Waco's most talked-about food destination. Within just two years, we earned the title of "Waco's #1 Food Truck" with consistent 5-star reviews, loyal customers who drive from across Central Texas, and recognition as the premier Mexican catering service in the region. Today, our food truck is where stories are shared, bellies are filled, and love is served daily to over 10,000+ satisfied customers who call us "the best Mexican food in Waco."</p>
                    
                    <p>Teresita's Birria is more than just a name on the side of a truck — it's a tribute. A tribute to a woman who poured her heart into everything she did, whether it was rocking our baby to sleep or simmering birria to perfection.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Gracias, Tere. This is for you.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p><em>And to all who visit our food truck — welcome to the family.</em></p>
